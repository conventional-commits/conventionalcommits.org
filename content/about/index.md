# About

The Conventional Commits specification is inspired by, and based heavily on, the [Angular Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

The first draft of this specification has been written in collaboration with some of the folks contributing to:

* [parse-commit-message](https://npmjs.com/package/parse-commit-message): Extensible utilities for parsing, stringify and validating Conventional Commit messages.

* [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna): a tool for managing monorepos, which grew out of the Babel project.
